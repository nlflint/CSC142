Lab 12: Collections

1) private java.util.ArrayList<String> reindeer;

2) reindeer = new ArrayList<String>();

3) app.reindeer = new java.util.LinkedList<String>();

4) No, not that I can tell.

5) The third call to print(), shows all the names twice.

6) app.reindeer = new java.util.HashSet();

7) Yes, the names are in a different order.

8) In the HashSet, I added the names twice, but they still only print once.
However, in the LinkedList I added the names twice and they showed up twice.

9)
public void print()
{
    Iterator<String> reindeerIterator = reindeer.iterator();
    while(reindeerIterator.hasNext())
        System.out.print(reindeerIterator.next() + " ");
    System.out.println();
}
