<h1>Homework Guidelines</h1>
<p>Guidelines for homework submissions. Note: "shall" indicates requirements; "should" indicates goals. That is, "shall" appears in guidelines that need to be followed for full credit. Whereas, "should" appears in guidelines that are "nice to have"s.</p>
<h2>Java Source Code Files</h2>
<p>Programs submitted shall be Java source code files, unless explicitly 
specified otherwise.</p>
<h3>General Considerations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Java source code file shall compile as submitted.<ul>
	<li>The name of the Java source code file shall end with the .java extension.</li>
	<li>There is a compiler requirement that public classes appear in files with 
	the same name.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The main class within the file shall be a public class.</li>
	<li>The source code shall be written for Java SE, version 5 or later.</li>
	<li>The compiled file shall run as a Java application which demonstrates all 
	functionality for grading. </li>
	<li>Submission of other files types shall be ignored. For example, compiled 
	bytecode (.class files), .back-up files from the IDE (.java~), archive files 
	(.zip, .rar, etc.) </li>
</ul>
<h3>Header Comment Block</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The source code file shall have an initial comment block.&nbsp; This 
	initial comment block may be a JavaDoc comment for the main class in the file. </li>
	<li>The 
	initial comment block shall include:
	<ul>
		<li>your name (first and last) </li>
		<li>the 
	number and name of the assignment (for example: Assignment 1: Class Tools). 
		</li>
		<li>the level at which you want the 
	assignment graded
		<ul>
			<li>for Assignment: Minimal, Standard, or Challenge</li>
			<li>for Labs: Minus, Check, 
			or Plus</li>
			<li>Submissions without 
			level indications in the initial comment block shall be graded at 
			the lowest level.</li>
			<li>Claiming a higher level 
			than is evident in the work submitted shall result in a style 
			penalty.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>optionally, a short description of the purpose of 
	the program.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>There shall be a blank line following the header comment. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Commenting</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All comments shall precede the associate Java code.</li>
	<li>All comments shall align vertically with the associated Java code.</li>
	<li> The goal of comments in the code is to explain why something is 
	happening or to explain the actions of a group of statements set apart by 
	blank lines. </li>
	<li>[week 2] Each class shall have an 
	associated JavaDoc comment. </li>
	<li>[week 2] Class JavaDoc comments shall 
	include @author tag with the student's name if the student has written the 
	class or made any changes to the code within the class.</li>
	<li>[week 3] Every method shall have an 
	associated comment. </li>
	<li>[week 2] Each public method shall have an 
	associated JavaDoc comment.</li>
	<li>[week 2] Method JavaDoc comments shall 
	include @param and @return tags, as appropriate.</li>
	<li>[week 4] Each field shall have an 
	associated comment.</li>
	<li>[week 4] Every public field shall have an 
	associated JavaDoc comment.</li>
	<li>[week 3] Every constructor shall have an 
	associated comment.</li>
	<li>[week 3] Each public constructor shall 
	have an associated JavaDoc comment.</li>
	<li>[week 3] Constructor JavaDoc comments 
	shall include @param tags, as appropriate. </li>
	<li>[week 2] The JavaDoc comments shall 
	appear immediately above the related resource: class or method. </li>
	<li>[week 2] There shall 
	be no blank line between the comment and the associated resource.</li>
	<li>[week 2] The JavaDoc tool shall not generate any warnings or errors when applied 
	to the submitted code. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fields</h3>
<ul>
	<li>[week 4] The norm for variables is to 
	make them local. The creation of a field shall be justified in the written 
	report.</li>
	<li>[week 4] The default access modifier for 
	fields in <b>private</b>.</li>
	<li>[week 4] All non-static fields shall be 
	initialized in the constructors.</li>
	<li>[week 4] No non-static field declarations shall include explicit initialization 
	code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Alignment</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Indentation shall reflected the 
	nesting structure of the code.</li>
	<li>[week 3] Each block is introduced by a 
	line "defining" the block, For example, the method header or class header. 
	The opening curly brace shall appear at the end of the line defining the 
	block or at the beginning of the following line.</li>
	<li>[week 3] The closing curly brace shall 
	appear as the first "printing" character on the line and align vertically 
	with the beginning of the defining line for the block.</li>
	<li>[week 3] The code within the block shall 
	be indented by a uniform amount.</li>
	<li>[week 3] Indentation for each level of 
	nesting shall be uniform within the source code file.</li>
	<li>[week 3] The indentation for blocks shall 
	be uniform, between 2 and 5 spaces. The default for many IDE editors is 4 
	spaces.</li>
	<li>[week 2] Blank lines shall separate the 
	methods within a class.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<ul>
	<li>[week 
	2] When specific user input value options are given in the write-up, the 
	code shall be written for exactly those options. Also, the order of 
	queries for user input shall not vary from what is given in the write-up. 
	Changed in the user interface will result in a style or functionality 
	deduction.</li>
	<li>[week 
	2] When numeric output has a specified precision, the values shall not be <i>rounded</i> to 
	the required precision. The output values shall be <i>formatted</i> to 
	the required precision. Calculated numeric values shall remain numeric until 
	they are output. The output values shall not be handled as strings <i>internally</i> to 
	the program.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There is a lot of code available from many sources, most notably, 
	the Internet. You are welcome to search for solutions to the programming 
	problems, with the following caveats:<ul>
		<li>The solution must conform to the algorithm specified in the write-up.</li>
		<li>You must understand the techniques which are used within the solution. 
		This includes being able to explain the code that was submitted or being 
		able to write similar code to solve related programming problems.</li>
		<li>The code will still be submitted to MOSS for similarity checking. 
		Therefore, it is wise to take a "Gilligan's Island" approach to using 
		code from any source outside of your own head.</li>
		<li>Noncompliance will result in a score of zero for the associated homework 
		activity.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>[week 3] All variables and parameters 
	shall be used. That is, the value of any variable or parameter shall be used 
	to support to generation of output (or return value in the case of a 
	method).</li>
	<li>[week 3] There shall be no <b>import</b> 
	declaration for resources which are not needed/used within that source code 
	file.</li>
	<li>The <b>
	static</b> 
	keyword shall not be used in homework.<br>
	Exception:<ul>
	<li>the application method</li>
	<li>[week 7] constants: public static final 
	fields</li>
</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plain Text Files</h2>
<p>Plain text files will be used when submitting assignment reports and other 
textual submissions, for example, some lab write-ups.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The name of the text file shall end with the .txt extension.</li>
	<li>The name of the text file shall consist of alphanumeric (a-z A-Z 0-9), 
	underscore, and hyphen characters , with exactly one period at the beginning 
	of the file extension.</li>
	<li>The name of the text file shall not contain any space characters.</li>
	<li>The text file shall have an initial comment block. The 
	initial comment block shall include your name (first and last) and the 
	number and name of the homework (for example: Assignment 1: Class Tools or 
	Lab 1: Background). </li>
	<li>The contents of the text file should include only ASCII characters. See Appendix 
	C in the textbook. Alternately, if the character appears on a standard 
	103-key keyboard, it should be "ok".</li>
	<li>The contents of the text file shall include only "textual" formatting. 
	These include space, newlines, *bold*, _italics_. The tab character should 
	be avoided since the interpretation of the tab character can vary.</li>
	<li>The lines should not exceed 80 characters per line.</li>
</ul>
