Quiz 5: Rounding

Q1: What is the value where the round-off error is first apparent?
A1: 3.0000001E10

Q2: Which iteration is the round-off error first apparent?
A2: The 10th iteration

Q3: What is the significance of the letter 'f' in the assignment of the initial
value of the variable number?
A3: Appending an "f" to the number, forces the type to be a float.

Q4: What happens if the 'f' is omitted in the initial value?
A4: the program fails to compile with an error.

Q5: What is the value where the round-off error is first apparent?
A5: 2.9999999999999997E28

Q6: Which iteration is the round-off error first apparent?
A6: The 28th iteration

Q7: Does this behavior change if the initial value is specified as 3.0f or 3.0?
A7: No

Q8: Does this behavior change if the initial value is specified as 3 (int)?
A8: No

Q9: Briefly the reason for the answers to questions 7 and 8.
A9: In 7 and 8, the literal numbers are narrower than double and widened double
during the assignment. The variable is essentially converted to double.

Q10: Something "odd" happens in the printed values for iterations 30-33,
inclusive. What is it? Try to explain the phenomenon.
A10: The precision is close enough that when rounded it looks like the values
come out correct. There is error, but it's not apparent.
