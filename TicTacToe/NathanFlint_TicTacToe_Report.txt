Assignment 3: Tic Tac Toe

I first studied the assignment and thought about how I could create a tic tac
toe board with the limited selection of Nscc components. Lines were the 
obvious choice. Lines could easily do the standard board, the colored board,
and the rotated board. The only problem was how to do the thick lines. My first
idea was to draw multiple lines, but you took away loops as an option. The my
next idea was to use rectangles, which worked well.

One thing I was proud of was reusing code. The code for all the boards had a
similar layout, and I was able combine it all into a single helper
function. The original board, colored board, and the rotated board are all the
same code. I did not combine the thickness board with them because rectangles
from the Nscc class can not be rotated. I could also have combined the code
in a different way leaving out the rotated board on it's own, but I chose not
to do that. I either choice was good.

Field vs local variable:
The NsccWindow should be a field because it needs to be shared between the 
different functions of the class. The NsccLine classes do not need to be private
because they are not shared between functions. If the NsccLines classes were
made into fields, then some readers of the code might be confused as well. They
might expect the variable to be shared, but it's not.
