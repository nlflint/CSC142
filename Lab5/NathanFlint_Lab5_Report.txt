Lab5: SnowmanIII

1) When I replaced both constructors with the example code, the application 
would not compile and gave the error: 
"java: /Users/nate/git/CSC142/Lab5/src/SnowmanIII.java:38: recursive constructor
invocation." This is because each constructor calls the other, in an endless
loop.

2) The hat disappears from the snowman

3) There is an error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException

4) Two different hat appear. I cannot move them both, because there is only
one reference and it points to the last hat created. The reference is the only
way to manipulate the hats, so only the last hat can be moved around. The 
reference to the first hat is lost, so it cannot be moved around.

5) Only a NsccComponent can be passed to the AddHat method, so my hat must be
of that type.

6) If the underlying component is too small, then my hat will be partially
clipped, or missing all together. I would see this and could correct it. If it's
too big, then it will be harder to tell because my hat will look fine.
