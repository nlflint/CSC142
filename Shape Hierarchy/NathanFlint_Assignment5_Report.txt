Assignment 5: Shape Hierarchy

I approached this assignment by first reading the minimum requirements from
instructions, and then reading the program source code. I saw some sort of
menu and became curious about it, so I ran the program to see what it looked
like. I was disappointed because I thought it would be a menu bar with graphics
but it was just a terminal/text style menu. Then I proceeded to complete the 
assignment from the top down.

The biggest decision was how to handle the MyTriangle class after creating the
MyRightTriangle class for the challenge option. I agonized over this, but
decided to make MyTriangle an incomplete class similar to MyShape and let the
two new triangles inherit from it. MyShape isn't very useful alone and isn't
even included in the menu. I did the same with MyTriangle by removing it from
the menu. This was risky, because I wasn't sure if I'd lose credit for not
having MyTriangle in the menu for the standard version. I also gave MyTriangle a
complete getArea() method. This method is not overridden by either triangle
subclasses because they used the same equation for their area.

One thing I wanted to do, but wouldn't work, was generalize MyTriangle. I was
hoping there would be some nice way to do it, but, as was stated in the
assignment, this isn't possible within the scope of the assignment.

I didn't have any major problems while doing the assignment, but I did miss some
info that would have helped me. I didn't see the question in MySquare before
asking a related question on the forum. Next time I should read the entire
source code and assignment, looking for questions.

Q1: MySquare class: no getArea ... why?
A1: 2. it was inherited from the superclass. The superclass (MyRectangle)
already has a getArea implementation for finding the area (base * height), and
that same equation works for squares too.
